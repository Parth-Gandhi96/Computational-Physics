# CS-201-Computational-Physics
# Here I have uploaded some of the Real life problem tried to solve upto some extend using concepts of Compuatation Physics.Though this is not the full description or a solution of any of the problems but it is just way how we can "start" solving them. Still there might be better solution for simulating this real life problems.
# All the Codes I have written are in MATLAB (Which is one of the best simulator & simulatin Language).
